## Project Description
The Hangman Game is a command-line based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. The project aims to practice and demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including class creation, methods, and attributes, as well as control flow and basic input/output operations.

### What it Does
- Allows the user to guess letters in a randomly chosen word.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Tracks the number of lives remaining and displays the partially guessed word.
- Ends the game when the word is guessed correctly or when the user runs out of lives.

### Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to:
- Practice OOP concepts in Python.
- Understand and implement control flow in a game scenario.
- Gain experience in handling user inputs and providing interactive feedback.

### What You Will Learn
- How to structure a Python project using classes and methods.
- How to implement basic game logic using control flow statements.
- How to handle user input and provide feedback.
